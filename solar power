# Voltaic battery must be in 'Always On' mode so it will recover if it looses power
# when battery runs out of power in 'Always On' mode, Rasberry Pi stops working
# battery must build up buffer power from solar panels to power up and restart Rasberry Pi
# avoid the above by putting Rasberry Pi into sleep mode as often as possible
# watch dog timer wakes up Rasberry Pi after specified time interval
# on cloudy days: run on batteries only
# at night: turn off Rasberry Pi
